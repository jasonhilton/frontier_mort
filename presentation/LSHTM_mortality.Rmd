# Motivations

Forecasts of population mortality have a wide range of important applications in government and the private sector.

- Pension policy

- Health care planning

- Life Insurance and annuity pricing


--
- As inputs to population forecasts, which in turn inform:
  + Housing decisions
  + Local development plans
  + Business planning (innovation, marketing)



---
# What properties should a forecast have?

- **Accuracy:** 
  + We want mortality estimates to be close to true values


--
- **Quantified Uncertainty:** 
  + A range of possible values provides for risk management (Keilman 2002, Bijak et al. 2015)
  + Combined with a cost function, this allows formal decision analysis tools to be used


--
- **Make use of all sources of information**
  + Existing (prior) knowledge about regularities in mortality may constrain models
  + Information about trends in other countries may be informative about current mortality


  
--
This paper will describe a probabilistic model for mortality forecasting that incorporates information about the long run change in *frontier mortality* into forecasts

# Mortality Forecasting - Previous Work


__Projecting UK mortality by using Bayesian generalized additive models__


__Model description__

$$log(\mu_{xt}) = \color{red}{s_{\alpha}(x)} + \color{blue}{s_{\beta}(x)}t +\color{purple}{s_{\gamma}(t-x)} +\color{orange}{\kappa_t}$$

- Log-mortality $\mu_{xt}$ is a sum of smooth functions of <span style="color:red"> age </span> and <span style="color:purple">cohort</span>, a set of smooth age-specific <span style="color:blue">mortality improvements</span>

- Additional <span style="color:orange">period </span> effects $\kappa$ capturing trend deviations (e.g. flu outbreaks), modelled as a random walk

- Transition from a GAM based model to a parametric logistic model at older ages where data is more sparse

- Smooth functions modelled using penalised B-splines

- Constrains on period and cohort terms are needed for identifiability

# Frontier Mortality

---
# Best practice life-expectancy

The seminal paper by Oeppen and Vaupel (2002) identifies a long-run linear trend in "best-practice" (period) life expectancy.


--
- Best practice is defined as the highest life expectancy globally.

- The sustainability of this linear trend was the subject of much debate (e.g. Olshanskly et al 2001)

- Oeppen and Vaupel showed that previously suggested limits to life expectancy tended to be breached not long after they were proposed.




---
# Why a linear trend?

Exactly why this linear trend should exist is debated. 

- Oeppen and Vaupel (2002) describe a “regular stream of continuing progress” resulting from a “intricate interplay of advances in income, salubrity, nutrition, eduction, sanitation, and medicine”(p. 1029)



--
- Theoretical work has identified possible processes:
  + Continuous re-investment of the proceeds of economic growth (Oeppen 2019)
  + Bengtsson (2019) suggests countries best practice life-expectancy may 
  experience slower growth, as they cannot 'borrow' techniques from more advanced neighbours



--
- Life expectancy in a particular period is the result of aggregation of mortality from many cohorts
  + Mortality experience is affected by the long-term experience of cohorts, not just by current events
  + Change is expected to be slow and steady


--
Some theoretical explanations, although we cannot be sure that linear change will continue.



---
# Existing work
Other work has attempted to make use of frontier mortality:


- Bijak (2004) assumed long-term convergence towards frontier life expectancy


- Torri and Vaupel (2012) modelled frontier life expectancy and the gap between this and country values using log-transform


- Pascariu, Canudas-Romo and Vaupel (2018) employed a two-gap model to include males and ensure forecast coherence


- Ebeling (2018) fitted smooth 2-d splines to mortality rate surfaces to identify the location of minimum mortality



---
# Life expectancy or mortality?
  
Lee and Carter (1992) and Tuljapurkar, Li, and Boe (2000) identify linear trends in log-mortality, rather than life expectancy, at country level.


--
Life expectancy is a non-linear function of the underlying mortality rates.

- Vaupel and Canudas (2003) show that change in life expectancy is a weighted sum of age-specific mortality improvements.
  + Weights change depending on the level of mortality
  + Linear improvements in mortality *constant across age* will result in linear life expectancy increases (Keyfitz 1977)


--
- Aburto et al. (2020) show these weights become more concentrated at older ages as mortality declines.


--
Linear change in mortality rates generally imply slightly decelerating growth in life expectancy. 

- This is seen to some extent in the data (Lee 2019)

# Descriptive Analysis


---
# Exploration

We wish to use trends in frontier mortality to inform a forecasting model

- We assume greater stability in the frontier than in country-specific mortality

- Do we observe linear trends in frontier mortality?



--
### Data
Data from Human Mortality Database from across the developed world provide the opportunity to jointly model the frontier and individual country rates


--
- Nineteen countries with reasonable population sizes and data going back to 1961 are chosen.


- Female data only
  + Men are unlikely to contribute to the frontier given their higher mortality




---
# Definitions

### Central Mortality Rate

$$m_{xt} = \frac{D_{xt}}{R_{xt}},$$ 
- $D_{xt}$ denotes the number of deaths of individuals aged between $x$ and $x+1$ during year $t$, 
- $R_{xt}$ is the exposure to risk during of the same group over that period, measured in terms of person-years lived.



### Mortality Frontier

The best (lowest) mortality rate at each year and age amongst all countries:

$$m_{xt}^{*} = \text{min}_c(m_{xtc}),$$ where $c$ indicates a particular country.

# Modelling Frontier Mortality

---
# Model structure


### Likelihood
$$D_{xtc} \sim \text{Negative Binomial}(m_{xtc}R_{xtc}, \; \text{exp}(\phi))$$


### Log-Rate Model

- The <span style="color:red">mortality frontier</span> is modelled using smooth age and improvement terms.

- Country rates incorporate <span style="color:blue">positive deviations</span> from frontier mortality.

- Additional <span style="color:purple">country-specific period effects</span> capture year to  year variation

$$\text{log}(m_{xtc}) = \color{red}{s_{\mu}(x) + s_{\beta}(x)t} + \color{blue}{s_{\gamma}^{c}(x)\text{exp}(h(x,t))} + \color{purple}{\kappa_{tc}}$$


---
# Model specification
The frontier model shares elements with previous work


- Smooth age-specific pattern of mortality
- Smooth age-specific mortality improvements

The country-specific element is constrained to be positive


- The coefficients on the age pattern of country-specific deviations $s_\gamma^c(x)$ are forced to be positive
- This ensures the frontier lies below all country specific surfaces
- Different choices possible for $h(x,t)$ function describing time evolution of deviations


---
# Model specification 
Without further priors and constraints, the model is unidentified, as the frontier could lie anywhere below the country specific rates


- Coefficients on country-specific deviations are penalised so that smaller 
values are favoured
  + Double exponential priors on the the deviations $s_\gamma^c(x)$

- Period effects are constrained to sum to zero and have zero linear and quadratic components

- In addition, standard smoothness penalties are employed for all spline coefficients

- Linear and quadratic age-specific functions are trialled for $h(x,t)$

### Estimation

# Conclusion


---
# Evaluation

The suitability of the model was tested using held back observations from 2007-2016. 

- RMSE was used of as the metric of comparison

Linear and quadratic models were compared to the simpler model below, fitted to each country independently:

$$\text{log}(m_{xt}) = s_{\mu}(x) + s_{\beta}(x)t + k_t$$


--
The quadratic model showed modest performance improvements versus this 'independence' model.

- Lower RMSE in 13 out of 19 countries

---
# Evaluation


### Strenths

- Combining information across countries allows robust estimates of smooth mortality frontier
- Country-specific mortality estimated jointly with the frontier
- Assumptions about frontier avoids extrapolations of recent steep declines indefinitely
- Individual countries can catch up or fall away from the frontier

### Limitations

- Quadratic model can lead to problematic extrapolations
- Assumption of linear frontier change
- Frontier estimates dependent on choice of countries in the data


---
# Future work

### Country-specific elements

Greater flexibility required in country-specific trends:

- Lee-Carter model 
- Currie model (2-dimensional spline)

These will also provide for more sensible long-term extrapolations.

### Frontier elements

Identifying change-points in development of the frontier (more speculative)


### Extensions

Double-gap two sex model (Pascariu et al. 2018)

# Covid implications

The majority of this work was conducted before COVID. 


--
How to incorporate the pandemic into long term forecasting models is an open question.

For the model described above:
- The $\kappa_tc$ terms will absorb some of the effect of the pandemic, although this will increase uncertainty going forward
- The pandemic could be captured by allowing a one-off effect capturing the mortality spike in 2020 and 2021
  + Country specific timings are an issue here

--
The long-term effects of pandemic are unclear:
- 'Harvesting' effects may reduce mortality in the short-term
- Will mutant variants of COVID persist in the population following vaccination programmes?
- Long-term effect of COVID on the health of those who where infected remains uncertain
  + Will 'Long Covid' and related disease affect health in the long term?
- Optimistically, COVID may spur further investments in the health system
